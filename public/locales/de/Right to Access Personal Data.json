The accuracy of {{name}} data is contested by the data subject, for a period enabling the controller to verify the accuracy of the personal data.
The processing is unlawful, and I oppose the erasure of the personal data and request the restriction of their use instead.

You no longer need the personal data for the purposes of the processing, but they are required by me for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims.

I have objected to processing pursuant toÂ§ 21(1) GDPR pending the verification whether the legitimate grounds of the controller override those of the data subject. "
